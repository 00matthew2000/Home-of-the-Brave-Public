WCC_rebuild_agriculture:0 "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"

WCC_scrap_what_we_can_desc:0 "Parents Organizations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage.

WCC_counter_propaganda:0 "Counter-Propaganda"

WCC_vegas_revenue:0 "Vegas Revenue"
WCC_vegas_revenue_desc:0 "The new regime recognizes the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home.

WCC_war_bonds:0 "Loyalist Bonds"
WCC_war_bonds_desc:0 "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
WCC_copper:0 "Copper, Copper and Copper"
WCC_copper_desc:0 "The creeds of Long and Reed were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
WCC_american_pompey:0 "American Pompey"
WCC_american_pompey_desc:0 "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organizations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
WCC_fate_of_marshall:0 "Marshall's Soldiers"
WCC_fate_of_marshall_desc:0 "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politicians ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than they."
WCC_fate_of_macarthur:0 "MacArthur's Men"
WCC_fate_of_macarthur_desc:0 "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional Democracy as he sees it.

WCC_patton:0 "Patton's Boys"
WCC_patton_desc:0 "George S. Patton was part of the reactionary faction that rose up in the South during the Civil War. His cause was admirable, but they betrayed our country, and we must make sure they do not rise up again. To accomplish this, we will instill a sense of nationalism amongst the men who were once Patton's Boys, so that they will fight just as hard for the United States of America as they did for their own cause."
WCC_vet_affairs:0 "Veteran Administration Bureau"
WCC_vet_affairs_desc:0 "A state that depends so heavily on its military must take care of its soldiers when they come home. Veterans will be a large group of our people now, and many of them did not fight for us. Let us create the Veteran Administration Bureau, so that we can win veterans of all sides over to our side. Perhaps we can win their favor and, if we need them again someday, they will heed the call."
WCC_wfc:0 "War Finance Corporation"
WCC_wfc_desc:0 "Our top officials have advised us to create a "War Finance Corporation". This government-run corporation would give support to industries that are crucial for our war effort.

WCC_ami:0 "Defense Logistics Agency"
WCC_ami_desc:0 "Our soldiers can fight, but our army needs to keep up with them. We need to get the munitions and supplies our factories produce to our men, and we need to get oil to our vehicles.

WCC_pension_subsidies:0 "Pension Subsidies"
WCC_pension_subsidies_desc:0 "We could still do a better job of taking care of our veterans.

We will also subsidize these veterans and help them live respectable lives in their waning days."
WCC_bureaucratic_justice:0 "Bureaucratic Justice"
WCC_bureaucratic_justice_desc:0 "Our government must do something to replace the old justice system of our country. Instead of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty, would it not be more efficient to presume their guilt and put the onus on the defendant? This would allow us to resolve cases faster, and perhaps allow us to get rid of some of our enemies as well..."
WCC_entente_relations:0 "Entente Relations"
WCC_entente_relations_desc:0 "Canada, along with the rest of the Entente, has assisted us in various ways during the Second Civil War. We should pursue closer relations with them, as they are our natural ideological allies. They understand our concentration on our military, as well as our fundamental principles, better than any other nation. They are also our neighbors. If we must co-exist, let us be allies."
WCC_containment:0 "Containment"
WCC_containment_desc:0 "Our foreign policy advisors have developed a doctrine to combat the rise of syndicalism in the Western Hemisphere. This may also hamper the growth of left wing movements here as well. The doctrine will be called "Containment", and we will give aid to countries in danger of falling to left wing radicals, as well as work to cause tension within nations that have already fallen. Let America show her might on the world stage."

WCC_the_fourth_branch:0 "Fourth Branch of Government"
WCC_the_fourth_branch_desc:0 "Some of our people have talked about a fourth branch of government for years. Now, there really will be a fourth branch. The military will be one of the main institutions of our government, and it will be as much of a pillar of it as the others are. Before long, it will likely be the only branch. Our people will never be unsafe again."
WCC_republican_traditions:0 "Republican Traditions"
WCC_republican_traditions_desc:0 "Our country was a republic since its inception. Things have changed since those days, but we will still retain many of our old republican traditions.

WCC_the_wise_men:0 "The Wise Men"
WCC_the_wise_men_desc: "With military officials in charge of our country, we can run things far more efficiently. The military will receive the attention it needs, and it will be larger and better funded than ever before. Our "Wise Men" sit at the top of it all and direct our men like pieces on a chess board. America will be a warrior society, more than Sparta, Rome, or Germany ever were."
WCC_think_tanks:0 "Think Tanks"
WCC_think_tanks_desc:0 "There have been many political think tanks in our country in past decades, and this has inspired us to create think tanks for the military as well. These think tanks will serve as the foremost research institutions in North America for military technology and strategy. We will be one of the most advanced armies in the world, and one day we shall even outmatch the Germans."
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study:0 "Institute for Advanced Study"
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study_desc:0 "We will create a hub for further research within our nation, so that our military can become the dominant force in our hemisphere and perhaps the world. We will also put a special emphasis on marines, mountaineers, and other special forces that we could use in a large variety of terrain."
WCC_american_finance_corporation:0 "Bank for Reconstruction and Development"
WCC_american_finance_corporation_desc:0 "Many of our areas are still devastated by the war. One idea to help reconstruction efforts is to create the B.R.D., which will give loans to the most devastated areas of our country. This will help them rebuild and recover from the conflict. We will also give loans to developping areas and states, so that they can become more prosperous than ever before."
WCC_restore_wall_street:0 "Restore Wall Street"
WCC_restore_wall_street_desc:0 "Before the Civil War, Wall Street was an important financial institution in our country. We should restore it, so that New York can become a global economic hub once again. 
WCC_i_shall_return:0 "I Shall Return"
WCC_i_shall_return_desc:0 "MacArthur has come to us beaten and bloodied. But, he is not broken. In fact, his resolve has never been stronger. Despite that, he has come to us a changed man. Wildly decrying revolutionaries and reactionaries, he speaks of our American identity, rallying our people to massacre those who have betrayed our country. Though we don't have much, we will use what we have to beat the traitors once and for all."
WCC_intensive_training:0 "Intensive Training"
WCC_intensive_training_desc:0 "One lesson MacArthur has taken away from his time in the East is that our soldiers need more training. He now insists we train them as much as humanly possible and push them to new levels, so that they will be unmatched in the battlefield. He will not be beaten twice."
WCC_advanced_security_forces:0 "Advanced Security Forces"
WCC_advanced_security_forces_desc:0 "Since MacArthur has arrived, it has been clear to everyone that he has become a very paranoid man. He is paranoid for good reason, though, given the state of our country. He demands the creation of new American security forces, specializing in special operations, in order to carry out any tasks he sees fit to bring order back to America. Some have whispered about the creation of a secret police force, but those dissenters are quickly silenced."
WCC_civilian_takeover:0 "Civilian Contributions"
WCC_civilian_takeover_desc:0 "Though MacArthur is humble enough to admit his own faults, he also blames the American people for not being committed enough to the war effort. We will conscript more men than ever before, and the people will be put to work. All will be sacrificed for our country, for without our country, we are nothing."

WCC_guerilla_tactics:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
WCC_guerilla_tactics_desc:0 "MacArthur became convinced of the effectiveness of guerilla tactics in his time in the East. If we can catch our enemy off guard, it does not matter if they outnumber us; we will destroy them all the same. We will utilize quick, silent strikes and disappear before the enemy even has a chance to react."
WCC_central_bureau:0 "Central Bureau"
WCC_central_bureau_desc:0 "At MacArthur's request, we have created a new "Central Bureau" to assist us in managing military affiars. It will be used as an intelligence service and as a tool to help us pursue aggressive warfare against our enemies. We will no longer be on the back foot-we will take the fight to our enemies!"
WCC_army_first:0 "Army First"
WCC_army_first_desc:0 "MacArthur knows he wouldn't last long without the loyalty of the army. He has made an effort to put them first in every move and decision he makes. From food rations to clothes to payment, the soldiers are served first, and in return they are expected to show the utmost loyalty. Most of them do. His soldiers worship him like a god, and he plans to use their fanaticism to his advantage, against enemies within and without."
WCC_the_watchmen:0 "The Watchmen"
WCC_the_watchmen_desc:0 "We have created a new paramilitary force of sorts, called the Watchmen. These are civilians who have agreed to spy on our citizens for us, for many reasons. Chief among them is the desire to keep MacArthur safe and to find any potential rivals or enemies within our country. We cannot risk betrayal, not now. Every effort will be taken to silence critics and get rid of traitors."
WCC_mobile_state:0 "The Mobile State"
WCC_mobile_state_desc:0 "Speed and aggression are tactics that MacArthur insists we make key pillars of our military. If we want to win wars, we have to strike our enemies before they have the chance to surround us, a fate he himself has experienced before. This time we will surround the enemy and force them to surrender with lightning speed."
WCC_address_congress:0 "Address Congress"
WCC_address_congress_desc:0 "As much as he embraces the term Caesar, MacArthur has no intentions of sharing the fate of his namesake. He has installed loyal men in Congress, and these men have made his case to the American people even better than he as one man ever could. MacArthur is more popular than ever, and the country is in his tight grip."
WCC_strangle_the_cobra:0 "Strangle the Cobra"
WCC_strangle_the_cobra_desc:0 "Our enemy has struck at us fast and hard. MacArthur barely escaped with his life. Now we will strike the Cobra and at last we will have victory in this brutal war. We will launch an offensive like never seen before on American soil, and perhaps we will launch greater ones across the sea. Hopefully this time will be different."
WCC_nuclear_program:0 "Nuclear Program"
WCC_nuclear_program_desc:0 "A few of our top scientists have privately suggested a nuclear weapons program to MacArthur. Such a weapon is still unknown and untested, and there are many who dismiss it and instead insist we focus on bomb production. MacArthur has been convinced, however, and has given the scientists the green light to proceed with this projet. The future is unknown, but we know one thing: it is ours to take."

WCC_dissident_fate_desc:0 "MacArthur is sick of dealing with dissidents in his country. He has been criticized from every side, and now he is taking action to make sure it never happens again. The military and homewatch organizations will round up dissidents and send them to military camps, where they will spend their days doing hard labor for our country. With their help, we will not lose."

WCC_expand_ACTS:0 "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
WCC_expand_ACTS_desc:0 "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the installations and officers from the Air WCCps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, in order to surpass the School set up in Langley Field in Virginia, we will need to expand on our installations."

wcc.1.t:0 "Western Command Center Requests Aid"
wcc.1.d:0 "In the United States, an outpost made up of Federalist Forces trapped in the West under General Omar Bradley is fighting a desperate fight for survival. They are now requesting aid from the entente in their fight against populism, socialism and the Pacific. Unlike the more ambigiously friendly MacArthur and Pacific States the WCC leadership seems far more respectful to the Entente and particularly Canada, and many of our advisors believe their survival would be in our best interests. Of course as others believe them to be a lost cause they recommend we do not loan them firearms, funds and small grouping of 'Independent Volunteers' as it would only antagonize a victorious faction."
wcc.1.a:0 "We must aid them"
wcc.1.b:0 "No, they are doomed anyways"

wcc.2.t:0 "Canada Sends Aid"
wcc.2.d:0 "It appears our diplomatic mission has paid off, with the WCC seemingly being the best ally Canada to choose in the war. Of course, there is no guarantee they are not going to aid other factions to hedge their bets, but at least we have the aid we need."
wcc.2.a:0 "Fantastic"

wcc.3.t:0 "Canada Refuses Aid"
wcc.3.d:0 "Our mission to Canada has failed! They appear to not believe we are capable of winning the war and, as such, have refused to support us."
wcc.3.a:0 "Bastards"

wcc.4.t:0 "Fate of PSA Generals"
wcc.4.d:0 "With the PSA having fallen to us, it is time to decide the fate of imprisoned members of their cause. Many are sympathetic to their desire to protect democracy though none will defend what they consider a rash decision to declare war on the federal government and nearly doom America to extremist ideologies that deny modern freedom. Nonetheless, we most would have their soldiers and officers rejoin America if they swear loyalty to the federal government, although doing the opposite will make allow a firmer grip of the West even if it will anger some officers."
wcc.4.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty it is"
wcc.4.b:0 "We can not forgive their treason"

wcc.5.t:0 "What of MacArthurists?"
wcc.5.d:0 "While we were willing to fight under MacArthur when it seemed the only means of defending Congress from the Red Guard, the Minutemen, the NDWL, the seccessionists and an impractical and hypocritical Pacific Congress that sought to overide the national government with its own, it became clear in time that MacArthur was not willing to give up power to either Congress, Eisenhower or Bradley and he would have to go. Now with MacArthur having fallen we must decide whether to offer him full amnety, revive his reputation and gain his mens support or end the threat once and for all."
wcc.5.a:0 "Make MacArthur a General"
wcc.5.b:0 "Declare him a traitor"

wcc.6.t:0 "The Fallen Cause"
wcc.6.d:0 "The South has been felled once again, along with all of the generals whom either agreed with the Old Democrat agenda or had the misfortune of already serving their states when the war started. General Patton was their most prominent leader and many would have us offer him and his men amnesty while maintaining the NDWL as a terrorist organization. However, most others view their cause as beyond redemption and claim that we would be repeating the error of the First Reconstruction in going too easy on the radical white league allies, and as such it will be a bit of an uphill battle to offer them amnesty and ruffle some feathers. Of course, to jail them would mean dealing with the potential backlash."
wcc.6.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty"
wcc.6.b:0 "We must finish their cause"

wcc.7.t:0 "American Standoff"
wcc.7.d:0 "With our foes having been felled in the war, the USA and the WCC are the only combatants left standing. However, our leadership has not always been on the best terms with MacArthur, as the Bradley-Eisnehower circle are nervous of giving MacArthur unchecked power and are hostile to his perceived egomania. As many view their alliance as one of pragmatism and neccesity against common enemies to the Federal Congress and military, many are wondering if the two can peacefully reconcile. If so, it is likely MacArthur will have to share power with Eisenhower and Bradley by giving them autonomous armies and administrations to run."
wcc.7.a:0 "Request he share power"
wcc.7.b:0 "Hit him now"
wcc.7.c:0 "No more bloodshed, reintegrate now"

wcc.8.t:0 "WCC Demands!"
wcc.8.d:0 "The WCC has always had a somewhat tense relationship with MacArthur due to the generals leading it, Eisenhower and Bradley, having more loyalty to the Federal Government, Military and Congress than to him, whom they distrust and view as an egomaniac. Now it has come to a head as they demand we relinquish some power in return for being re-annexed into the US. In this scheme Eisenhower would have a near-automous military government overseeing the reconstruction of the former AUS while Bradley's army would essentially govern the WCC and Pacific States. While MacArthur would still be the executive, this would prevent him from having a total handle on the situation. While some generals consider this treachery, Congressional advisors would prefer we take the deal."
wcc.8.a:0 "Very Well"
wcc.8.b:0 "Treachery, Strike Now!"

wcc.9.t:0 "MacArthur Accepts!"
wcc.9.d:0 "MacArthur has accepted our terms for peaceful reunifications and as such we have both prevented a potential tyranny and reunited America."
wcc.9.a:0 "God Bless America"

wcc.10.t:0 "WCC Reintegrates"
wcc.10.d:0 "Bradley and Eisenhower have acknowledged their lower rank to MacArthur and the United States, agreeing to hand over the WCC to him. This is a relief as they are known to have a sometimes tense relationship with MacArthur, making this a major victory. Of course, we should celebrate their actions and give them the highest honors we can to make the transition smoother."
wcc.a:0 "America is Saved!"

wcc.11.t:0 "MacArthur Assumes Command!"
wcc.11.d:0 "General MacArthur has decided he can no longer hold the East and now desires to move his outpost West, where we enjoy superior natural defenses. Of course, privately our leadership is not enthusiastic about this given Eisenhower and Bradley have a tense relationship with the General of the Armies and do not look forward to serving under him, especially given that MacArthur's faction and support base in the West are quite radical and now are even moreso after MacArthur sent word D.C. may be lost. However, our resources are few and that same faction could cause problems if we refuse, something we can not afford, so it appears we have little choice but to give in. Of course, rejecting him would be essentially a declaration of war as it would be a refusal to recognize his authority."
wcc.11.a:0 "Welcome him"
wcc.11.b:0 "Refuse him"

wcc.12.t:0 "WCC Welcomes Us!"
wcc.12.d:0 "The WCC has welcomed us to the West! As such we are preparing our expedition West, likely cutting through a neutral or friendly nation to reach it. Of course, with the situation now increasingly dire MacArthur's radical supporters in the West, nicknamed ' Radical Federalists' have put forward an extreme proposal to save America from the subversive extremists who threaten it and, in the process, us. Already, George Kenney and Richard K. Sutherland have joined them, neccessitating MacArthur's reliance on them."
wcc.12.a:0 "We shall not fail"

#WCC's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

WCC_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
WCC_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
WCC_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
WCC_CLARENCE_HUEBNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 24, 1888, in Bushton, Kansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clarence Ralph Huebner was born into a poor farming family, and so he was unable to afford joining the military academy outright. Instead, he enlisted as a private for the Army, serving in the 18th Infantry Regiment for nearly seven years and reaching the rank of Sergeant by 1916. He took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition, performing remarkably and earning the rank of Second Lieutenant, after which he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. He reached the rank of Major before becoming a teacher in the academy from 1929 to 1933. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1934 and has served with the Office of Chief of Infantry since then, putting him next in line for the promotion of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has grown personally attached to leading the 1st Infantry Division 'The Big Red One' due to his years of service within it."

He was assigned as a Captain of the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard until 1916 when he quit military life to focus his energy on his job as an Engineer. This lasted until the National Guard was recalled shortly afterwards for the Pancho Villa Expedition, however, he didn’t see any action there. Wanting to further his military career, he joined the Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill in 1921, graduating the next year and remaining as an instructor until 1926. He was then assigned to the command of Battery 'D' in the 24th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines. He remained there until 1928 where he was assigned to the 18th Field Artillery Regiment in Fort Riley. He later attended the Army Command and General Staff School in 1932, graduating two years later and went to Harvard University as an instructor of the ROTC, reaching the rank of Major in 1935.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Currently undergoing training at the Army War College and is expected to graduate in early 1937."

He was first assigned to the 6th Cavalry Regiment until 1916, where he took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition. After the return of the Expedition, he became an instructor at West Point. He was later assigned to the Panama Canal Division as Assistant Chief of Staff to Fox Conner. He returned in 1923 to sign up for the Army Command and Staff School, graduating in 1926. He then climbed the ranks until becoming Chief of Supply in the Supply Division within the War Department.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Currently attending the Army War College and expected to graduate in early 1937."
WCC_JONATHAN_WAINWRIGHT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 23, 1883, in Walla Walla, Washington, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Jonathan Mayhew 'Skinny' Wainwright IV began his military career being commissioned as a Cavalry Second Lieutenant after graduating West Point in 1906. He was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in Texas from 1906 to 1908 and later took part in fighting the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines between 1908 and 1910. He later graduated from the Mounted Service School in Fort Riley, before being promoted to Captain in 1916 and becoming an instructor there. He was assigned in 1921 to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment between 1923 and 1925. He then took up several staff positions until being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1929, before signing up to the Command and General Staff School and Army War College, where he graduated in 1931 and 1934 respectively. Wainwright was promoted to colonel in 1935, and with rumours of dissent within the cavalry corps, Wainwright was given an early promotion to Brigadier General in late 1935 for his loyalty to MacArthur."
WCC_LEONARD_GEROW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 13, 1888, in Petersburg, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leonard Townsend 'Gee' Gerow began his military career attending the Virginia Military Institute, from where he graduated as a recipient of an 'Honor Appointment', which allowed him to completely skip West Point and become an Infantry second lieutenant in September 1911. In 1915 he received a commendation for his work in the hurricane relief efforts around Galveston, Texas, and served at and near the city of Veracruz during the Pancho Villa Expedition, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917. He then took up an interest in the signal corps, serving without much distinction until signing up in the Advanced Course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning, graduating top of his class in 1925, with Omar Bradley being second. He then entered the Army Command and General Staff School, becoming a friend of Dwight Eisenhower and graduating in 1926.

Warren. However, he did poorly and was dismissed from the academy in just one semester. His mother managed to convince the Senator to appoint him again the next year, but he dropped out, and while the Senator tried to appoint him for a third time the following year, he was rejected by the academy itself. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and undeterred by his experience in West Point, he took the officer's qualifying exam in 1906, achieving the highest grade of all the applicants. On February 13, 1907, he was finally commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant. Lloyd would then spend the rest of the decade working in several of the army's overseas schools, where he built a reputation of being an excellent teacher, trainer and administrator of troops. Like many other officers, he filled a series of staff and garrison duties in the United States during the twenties. He became both an instructor and student at the U.S. Army Infantry School, graduating in 1923 with distinction from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School and graduating from the U.S. Army War College. During the early thirties, he was posted at the Statistics Branch of Washington, as the Inspector General's Department and later as Executive officer of the Office of the Chief of Infantry. During these staff duties, he met and has held close relations with both George Marshall and Leslie McNair, both of which nominated Fredendall for the rank of Brigadier General, a request that was granted by MacArthur in late 1935. Since then, Fredendall has strengthened his relations with both McNair, Marshall and Marshall's protege, Dwight Eisenhower."
