wcc.1.t:0 "Western Command Center Requests Aid"
wcc.1.d:0 "In the United States, an outpost made up of Federalist Forces trapped in the West under General Omar Bradley is fighting a desperate fight for survival. They are now requesting aid from the entente in their fight against populism, socialism and the Pacific. Unlike the more ambigiously friendly MacArthur and Pacific States the WCC leadership seems far more respectful to the Entente and particularly Canada, and many of our advisors believe their survival would be in our best interests. Of course as others believe them to be a lost cause they recommend we do not loan them firearms, funds and small grouping of 'Independent Volunteers' as it would only antagonize a victorious faction."
wcc.1.a:0 "We must aid them"
wcc.1.b:0 "No, they are doomed anyways"

wcc.2.t:0 "Canada Sends Aid"
wcc.2.d:0 "It appears our diplomatic mission has paid off, with the WCC seemingly being the best ally Canada to choose in the war. Of course, there is no guarantee they are not going to aid other factions to hedge their bets, but at least we have the aid we need."
wcc.2.a:0 "Fantastic"

wcc.3.t:0 "Canada Refuses Aid"
wcc.3.d:0 "Our mission to Canada has failed! They appear to not believe we are capable of winning the war and, as such, have refused to support us."
wcc.3.a:0 "Bastards"

wcc.4.t:0 "Fate of PSA Generals"
wcc.4.d:0 "With the PSA having fallen to us, it is time to decide the fate of imprisoned members of their cause. Many are sympathetic to their desire to protect democracy though none will defend what they consider a rash decision to declare war on the federal government and nearly doom America to extremist ideologies that deny modern freedom. Nonetheless, we most would have their soldiers and officers rejoin America if they swear loyalty to the federal government, although doing the opposite will make allow a firmer grip of the West even if it will anger some officers."
wcc.4.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty it is"
wcc.4.b:0 "We can not forgive their treason"

wcc.5.t:0 "What of MacArthurists?"
wcc.5.d:0 "While we were willing to fight under MacArthur when it seemed the only means of defending Congress from the Red Guard, the Minutemen, the NDWL, the seccessionists and an impractical and hypocritical Pacific Congress that sought to overide the national government with its own, it became clear in time that MacArthur was not willing to give up power to either Congress, Eisenhower or Bradley and he would have to go. Now with MacArthur having fallen we must decide whether to offer him full amnety, revive his reputation and gain his mens support or end the threat once and for all."
wcc.5.a:0 "Make MacArthur a General"
wcc.5.b:0 "Declare him a traitor"

wcc.6.t:0 "The Fallen Cause"
wcc.6.d:0 "The South has been felled once again, along with all of the generals whom either agreed with the Old Democrat agenda or had the misfortune of already serving their states when the war started. General Patton was their most prominent leader and many would have us offer him and his men amnesty while maintaining the NDWL as a terrorist organization. However, most others view their cause as beyond redemption and claim that we would be repeating the error of the First Reconstruction in going too easy on the radical white league allies, and as such it will be a bit of an uphill battle to offer them amnesty and ruffle some feathers. Of course, to jail them would mean dealing with the potential backlash."
wcc.6.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty"
wcc.6.b:0 "We must finish their cause"

wcc.7.t:0 "American Standoff"
wcc.7.d:0 "With our foes having been felled in the war, the USA and the WCC are the only combatants left standing. However, our leadership has not always been on the best terms with MacArthur, as the Bradley-Eisnehower circle are nervous of giving MacArthur unchecked power and are hostile to his perceived egomania. As many view their alliance as one of pragmatism and neccesity against common enemies to the Federal Congress and military, many are wondering if the two can peacefully reconcile. If so, it is likely MacArthur will have to share power with Eisenhower and Bradley by giving them autonomous armies and administrations to run."
wcc.7.a:0 "Request he share power"
wcc.7.b:0 "Hit him now"
wcc.7.c:0 "No more bloodshed, reintegrate now"

wcc.8.t:0 "WCC Demands!"
wcc.8.d:0 "The WCC has always had a somewhat tense relationship with MacArthur due to the generals leading it, Eisenhower and Bradley, having more loyalty to the Federal Government, Military and Congress than to him, whom they distrust and view as an egomaniac. Now it has come to a head as they demand we relinquish some power in return for being re-annexed into the US. In this scheme Eisenhower would have a near-automous military government overseeing the reconstruction of the former AUS while Bradley's army would essentially govern the WCC and Pacific States. While MacArthur would still be the executive, this would prevent him from having a total handle on the situation. While some generals consider this treachery, Congressional advisors would prefer we take the deal."
wcc.8.a:0 "Very Well"
wcc.8.b:0 "Treachery, Strike Now!"

wcc.9.t:0 "MacArthur Accepts!"
wcc.9.d:0 "MacArthur has accepted our terms for peaceful reunifications and as such we have both prevented a potential tyranny and reunited America."
wcc.9.a:0 "God Bless America"

wcc.10.t:0 "WCC Reintegrates"
wcc.10.d:0 "Bradley and Eisenhower have acknowledged their lower rank to MacArthur and the United States, agreeing to hand over the WCC to him. This is a relief as they are known to have a sometimes tense relationship with MacArthur, making this a major victory. Of course, we should celebrate their actions and give them the highest honors we can to make the transition smoother."
wcc.a:0 "America is Saved!"

wcc.11.t:0 "MacArthur Assumes Command!"
wcc.11.d:0 "General MacArthur has decided he can no longer hold the East and now desires to move his outpost West, where we enjoy superior natural defenses. Of course, privately our leadership is not enthusiastic about this given Eisenhower and Bradley have a tense relationship with the General of the Armies and do not look forward to serving under him, especially given that MacArthur's faction and support base in the West are quite radical and now are even moreso after MacArthur sent word D.C. may be lost. However, our resources are few and that same faction could cause problems if we refuse, something we can not afford, so it appears we have little choice but to give in. Of course, rejecting him would be essentially a declaration of war as it would be a refusal to recognize his authority."
wcc.11.a:0 "Welcome him"
wcc.11.b:0 "Refuse him"

wcc.12.t:0 "WCC Welcomes Us!"
wcc.12.d:0 "The WCC has welcomed us to the West! As such we are preparing our expedition West, likely cutting through a neutral or friendly nation to reach it. Of course, with the situation now increasingly dire MacArthur's radical supporters in the West, nicknamed ' Radical Federalists' have put forward an extreme proposal to save America from the subversive extremists who threaten it and, in the process, us. Already, George Kenney and Richard K. Sutherland have joined them, neccessitating MacArthur's reliance on them."
wcc.12.a:0 "We shall not fail"

#WCC's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

WCC_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
WCC_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him.
